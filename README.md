## Abstract

Some people have blue eyes, others brown, others have male genitalia and others female. Still some have long flowing blonde hair and others curly black hair. It is generally believed that the wide variety of traits seen in human beings is a result of Darwinian evolution. Specifically, that a wide variety of traits spreed by means of sexual reproduction creates the necessary diversity to continue to adapt to the environment which we find ourselves.

In the realm of computer science, specifically software programmers often create variable “settings” that allow users to customize the software experience to meet the specific needs of the user / user’s environment A simple example might be a setting that simply stores the company name on the software’s reports. Settings are often stored in a name/value pair so that the software an easily consume the setting and sometimes specifically alter the flow of the program to meet the desired outcome. “Settings” therefore can be seen as analogous to DNA “traits”.  To be ‘read’ and alter the flow to better match the need of the user’s environment.

This paper explores a method for storing settings in a manner that allows those settings to propagate across systems using an analogous approach to DNA and evolution. It does not claim to be a replicate of DNA for software but instead an algorithm to simulate the storage and retrieve of variable software settings. The application of this technology is left to the imagination of the reader.
